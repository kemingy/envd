# Refactor the IR to use state

## Summary

This proposal is designed to refactor the IR, as we discussed in [envd/#91](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd/issues/91#issuecomment-1239405359).

## Motivation

* Currently, we build the image with hard-coded order and parallelism. It's not flexible enough for some use cases.
* The design of buildkit LLB state is suitable for method chaining implementation. Users can define the dependencies and parallelism easily.

## Goals

* Able to define the order and parallelism.
* Provide low level APIs to build the image from scratch.

## API

```python
def conda_env(root):
    conda = root.env("MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX", "/opt/conda").run(
        [
            "curl micro.mamba.pm/install.sh | sh -s -- -y",
            "/opt/conda/bin/micromamba create -n envd python={}".format("3.10"),
        ]
    )
    return conda


def build():
    root = (
        Image("ubuntu:22.04")
        .apt_packages(
            ["curl", "wget"], update=True, clean=True, without_recommends=True
        )
        .run(["curl https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh -s -- -y"], mount=None)
        .copy(
            Image("tensorchord/envd-sshd-from-scratch:latest"),
            source_path="/usr/bin/envd-sshd",
            dest_path="/var/envd/bin/envd-sshd",
        )
    )
    return conda_env(root)
```

## Risk

* Implementation in Starlark
* VSCode language server
